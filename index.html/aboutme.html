            <h2>Gavin Blair</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Gavin Blair. I have been living in Woodbridge, Virginia for the last 12 years. I am 20 years old, and this is my first semester. I am the youngest of four, and I have autism.
                I was a service missionary from August 2023 to August 2025. My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:17, because it shows what being a service missionary is about. 
                Some of my hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, dancing, and making PowerPoints. 
                One fun fact about me is that over a year ago, I went viral on TikTok for doing Just Dance videos where I'm dancing without looking at the screen. Just Dance themselves commented on it, and they gave me the jacket in the photo.
