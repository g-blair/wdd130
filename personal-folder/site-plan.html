        The purpose of this website is for more information about regular polytopes in three and four dimensions.
        A polytope is a shape in any dimension that is made of straight lines. For a polytope to be regular, if all of its components are the same. 
        In 2D, a polytope is regular if all of its sides are the same length. This means there are infinitely many regular polygons, because you can just keep adding sides.
        For dimensions higher than two, regular polytopes are much less common, because there are more restrictions. 
        There are regular polytopes in 5D and higher, but they aren't really that interesting, because they are the same three as you go higher and higher. 3D and 4D are much more interesting, because there are more than three, but much less than infinity.
        Regular polytopes for dimensions higher than two are often called Platonic Solids. The reason these are called Platonic Solids is because Plato loved them, and he believed that they are what make up the elements of our universe. 
        The reason we know what the Platonic Solids in 5D and above are is because we look at the 4D Platonic Solids, see what we can fit around a vertex, and how many can fit around it. Most Platonic Solids in 4D are too round to be used for a 5D Platonic Solid, which is why there's only three of them.
        This is a really fascinating subject for me. If you want more information about higher dimensions, there are really great YouTube videos talking about them.

      <h3>3D Polytopes</h3>
      <p>
        Polytopes in 3D are called polyhedra. For a polyhedron to be regular, each face has to have the same shape, each vertex has to have the same number of faces meeting, and each edge has to be identical. You can join regular polygons to make regular polyhedra.
        It's worth noting that in 3D, there are 48 regular polyhedra, but to prevent this from getting way more complicated than it already is, I'll only talk about the Platonic Solids.

      </ul>
      <h3>4D Polytopes</h3>
      <p>
        Polytopes in 4D are called polychora. For a polychoron to be regular, each cell, or polyhedra, has to be the same, each vertex has the same number of cells meeting, and the rest of the requirements are the same for polyhedra.
        There are other cool 4D shapes like the famous Klein Bottle, which is a bottle that looks like it's passing through itself, which it is in 3D. In 4D, on the other hand, it's not passing through itself. I won't be covering it for this website, as it's not a regular polytope, but it's still something I wanted to highlight.
        It's worth noting that because our universe is 3D, we don't really know what regular polychora actually look like. The reason we know what the 4D Platonic Solids are is because we can see how many of a 3D Platonic Solid can fit around a vertex.
        The best we can do with seeing what 4D polytopes look like is by using a 3D projection of a 4D shape. As you'll see in the projections, a lot of the cells are distorted, because we can't get it to work in our universe. In 4d, however, all of the cells are regular polyhedra.
         For the image you see of the 4D equivalent of the cube, you'll see that it looks like there's a tiny cube inside of it. In true 4D space, the cube that looks like it's inside is actually in the back.
